# Electronics project at Summer lab 2019 in Ostritz
During the summer lab 2019 at [Internationales Begegnungszentrum St. Marienthal](https://ibz-marienthal.de/) in Ostritz we built a station for weather and environmental data programmed in CircuitPython to support the (micro-)plastics studies in Polish, German and Czech running waters.
